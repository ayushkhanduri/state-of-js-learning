# What is this about

This contains examples from the [State of JS survey](https://survey.devographics.com/survey/state-of-js/2022/read-only/1). I make this to understand
the new features of Javascript and write examples to better my understanding of them.

### Some of the topics covered in this are (will be updated as i add more examples):

1. Proxies
2. ```Promise.allSettled```(Difference between Promise.allSettled and Promise.all)
3. Dynamic Import
4. Nullish Coalescing
